Hello! I'm a Research Assistant at New York University Abu Dhabi focused on using machine learning to model the climate of Mars. I work at the [Center for Space Science](https://nyuad.nyu.edu/en/research/faculty-labs-and-projects/center-for-space-science.html) with Dr. Dimitra Atri and Professor Katepalli Sreenivasan. Before this, I pursued my undergraduate studies in Computer Science at NYU Abu Dhabi, where my research centered on adversarial machine learning for safeguarding users' privacy. 

My current research interests broadly lie in interpretable and adversarial machine learning, aiming to improve the trustworthiness and "fairness" of AI models. I am also interested in the applications of machine learning in scientific domains, particularly in climate and space science.

Beyond research, I'm passionate about music. During my undergraduate studies, I pursued a minor in Sound and Music Computing. I enjoy combining AI and music and some of my personal projects included AI music generation inspired by my favorite composers, sentiment analysis of popular songs, and predicting Spotify users' behaviors. I play classical piano and also enjoy exploring the historical and cultural nuances of classical music.
